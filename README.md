## 🚨 AWS Project - AWS API Gateway to Lambda Tutorial in Python | Build a HTTP API (2/2)

API Gateway is an AWS service that allows you to build HTTP or REST APIs. In this tutorial, I walk you through how to create a HTTP endpoint, followed by how to create a Lambda function and how to connect the Lambda function to the API Gateway endpoint!


## 🤖 Project Overview

I'm going to show you how to create a http api using api gateway in aws, we're going to be creating two routes for our api the first one is called `/getPerson` and that's going to be a get api and the second one is going to be called `/createPerson` and that's a post api. 

These are going to be backed by a single lambda function and i'm going to add some conditional logic in this lambda function so that it can handle both of these different endpoints.


## 📋 The Application Architecture

# 👉 Step 1: creating the http api in the api gateway

Go to the console and navigate to api gateway, choose HTTP API then click build

Click on add integration, the drop down lets us specify what we want to do, we want to select
lambda for our integration since we're going to create a lambda function now it's asking us for some of the
details of that lambda function it's asking us for the aws region that it's located in and the name of that lambda function.

But before that let's create a lambda function first then we will come back to select the lambda function

Go to the search bar and search for lambda, go to the top right and click on create function

Author from scratch is a good option to use, we're going to leave pretty much everything default leave put in whatever name you want so mine was just called CrudAppFunction function and we are going to be using python 3.8 so make sure you pick python 3.8 leave everything else defaults and click create function

We're going to doing do some code editing a little bit later in the console, directly in the editor if we click on `lambda_function.py` that is what is currently in this lambda function, it's just a lambda handler it's returning hello from lambda, we're going to keep for now so what i want to do now and come back to that later
